This project is a personal site built to document the restoration of my 1971 Volkswagen Baywindow Bus — one wrench turn at a time. Along the way, I’m also using it as a learning ground to explore modern web development with:

SolidStart – A fast, modern framework built on SolidJS

Kobalte – Accessible, headless UI components for Solid

The site is part blog, part digital garage, and part developer playground — mixing geospatial skills, vintage mechanics, and web tech into one ongoing project.

Restoring an old VW Bus is slow, messy, and full of lessons — just like learning new frameworks. This project gives me space to reflect on both processes: what I fix, what I break, and what I learn along the way.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
